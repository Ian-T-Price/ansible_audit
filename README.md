# Ecommerce-Config
Configuration settings for the Ecommerce Web stacks

This is a POC - Proof of Concept, for a VCS - Version Control System

############
## Basics ## 
############

1) We are using GIT VCS on GitHub.com as our VCS host.  As of 2015-07-10 we are using the EuroCarParts account for the POC &
   VCS. This can be found at https://github.com/EuroCarParts and Ian.Price@eurocarparts.com is the main contact for admin.

2) ECPIT have one repository (repo) for the POC - https://github.com/EuroCarParts/Ecommerce-Config
   Ian.Price@eurocarparts.com can add users.
   
3) Before a person can be added to the repo they need to create an account on http://github.com.  
   The repo can be accessed via HTTPS but our policy is to use SSH keys with passphrases. These can be created using ssh-keygen
   on Linux systems. 

4) The Git client needs to be loaded on the local PC.
